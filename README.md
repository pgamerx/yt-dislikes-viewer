# Important
Hello, I have quite recently checked the YouTube's official change-logs and it appears to be that they will avoid giving dislikes in the YouTube Data API. That is the reason I am dispatching an archiving API that will permit anybody to see dislikes of any videos. This package will continue to log number of dislikes of any video and feed it to the API. In future, we will improve!

# Installation 
## For Chromium-based Browsers (Edge,Chrome,Brave,Opera/OperaGX,Vivaldi etc.)
* ### Manually (Through Github Releases)
1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/pgamerx/yt-dislikes-viewer/releases/latest) (chromium.zip) and unzip it.
2. Navigate to your browser's extensions page. It's `chrome://extensions` for Chrome and `edge://extensions` for Microsoft Edge and **enable developer mode**.
3. Click **Load Unpacked** and, select the unzipped folder.
4. Once the extension is added to your browser, click the extension icon and enter your YouTube v3 Data API key (More info on the popup)

* ### Through Chrome Web Store
1. Head over to Google ChromeStore and navigate to [this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yt-dislikes-viewer/ekabjflbgeakdkhdneeakapgboleidee).
2. Press Add to `[BROWSER]` button, `[BROWSER]` may be chrome, brave, edge, or etc.

More reference on how to manually install extensions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#manifest).

## For FireFox
* ### Through Mozilla Addon Store
1. Head over to Mozilla Add-on Store and navigate to [this extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/yt-dislikes-viewer/).
2. Install it by clicking "Add Add-on" button.

* ### Manually (Through Github Releases)
This is not recommended as it's much difficult to add a extension manually to Mozilla Firefox, however assuming you do choose to do it then the steps are similar to that of a Chronium-Based Browser.
## Contribution
I can't deal with this extension all alone, that is the reason I really want your help to keep it up to stamp with the most recent youtube updates. Feel free and star/fork this repo and work on it!
