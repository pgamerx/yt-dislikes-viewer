1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/pgamerx/yt-dislikes-viewer/releases/latest) (chromium.zip) and unzip it.
2. Navigate to your browser's extensions page. It's `chrome://extensions` for Chrome and `edge://extensions` for Microsoft Edge and **enable developer mode**.

4. Once the extension is added to your browser, click the extension icon and enter your YouTube v3 Data API key (More info on the popup)

2. Install it by clicking "Add Add-on" button.

* ### Manually (Through Github Releases)
This is not recommended as it's much difficult to add a extension manually to Mozilla Firefox, however assuming you do choose to do it then the steps are similar to that of a Chronium-Based Browser.
## Contribution
I can't deal with this extension all alone, that is the reason I really want your help to keep it up to stamp with the most recent youtube updates. Feel free and star/fork this repo and work on it!
