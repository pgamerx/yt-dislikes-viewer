# Important
Hey there, I have just checked the Youtube's official change-logs and it seems that they will stop providing dislikes in the youtube Data API.
That's why I am launching an archiving API that will allow anyone to see dislikes of any videos. This package will keep logging number of dislikes of any video and feed it to the API. In future, we will do something even better!

# Installation 
## For Chromium-based Browsers (Edge,Chrome,Brave,Opera/OperaGX,Vivaldi etc.)
* ### Through Chrome Web Store
1. Head over to Google ChromeStore and navigate to [This extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yt-dislikes-viewer/ekabjflbgeakdkhdneeakapgboleidee).
2. Press Add to `[BROWSER]` button, `[BROWSER]` may be chrome, brave, edge, or etc.

* ### Manually (Through Github Releases)
1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/pgamerx/yt-dislikes-viewer/releases/latest) and unzip it.
2. Navigate to your browser's extensions page. It's `chrome://extensions` for Chrome and `edge://extensions` for Edge and **enable developer mode**.
3. Click **Load Unpacked** and, select the unzipped folder.
4. Once the extension is added to your browser, click the extension icon and enter your yt v3 Data API key (More info on the popup)

More reference on how to manually install extensions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#manifest).

## For FireFox
* ### Through Mozilla Addon Store
1. Head over to Mozilla Add-on Store and navigate to [This extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/yt-dislikes-viewer/).
2. Install it by clicking "Add Add-on" button.

* ### Manually (Through Gitub Releases)
This is not recommended as it's much difficult to add a extension manually to Mozilla Firefox, but if you do decide to do it then the steps are similar to that of Chromium-based browser
## Contribution
I cannot manage this extension on my own, that's why I need your support to keep it up to mark with the latest youtube updates. Feel free to star/fork this repo and work on it
